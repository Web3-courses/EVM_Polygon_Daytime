## Day_10 : Dapp

This is the tenth day of the full day version of the EVM â†’ Polygon bootcamp.

Link for actual repo: [Main repo](https://github.com/Web3-courses/Polygon_Blog/tree/main/client/reactDapp/reactdapp)

In this session, we will build a simple dapp using react

## Instructions

This file explains how the react app can actually get and create data from the smart contarcts ABI.

## Create the ract app

The very first step is to create the react app for our frontend

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Create a utils folder inside src so that we can import ABI and contract address

1. Create a utils folder
2. Copy the files --> blogContractABIFinal.json and blog_constants.js from the utils folder in client folder

## Follow the instructions on the app.js file

You should be able to see a very normal interaction interface design with the smart contracts.

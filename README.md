# EVM -> Polgyon Daytime course(FREE)
![Hero Img](PolygonEthereum_Course.jpg)

This repo is specific to the EVM -> Polygon daytime course. 

## Pre-Requisites

The course requires a sound understanding of JavaScript for the individual to get the most from this course. We expect that students taking this course have a keen interest in blockchain technologies, and want to continue to develop their understanding, building and deployment of code into the community.

## Expectations of Learners

This course will take students from a position of interest into blockchain technologies, through core concepts around blockchain technologies, setting up of Solidity in their IDE, understanding the Polygon EcoSystem, writing basic smart contracts, deploying TestNets, creating dApps and building a conceptual dApp on live TestNet. 

Becoming a capable engineer cannot be taught over a period of an eight day bootcamp. The purpose of this bootcamp is to create capability that can be refined, adapted, grown and deployed over weeks, months and years. We aim to give developers a sound grounding in the technology so that they can become builders of great use cases tomorrow.

## Overview of Course Syllabus

The course is an eight day, intensive, full day bootcamp where students are expected to also complete reading, homework and consider core concepts to progress their knowledge overnight. The course is broken down into the following overview.

## Daywise Agenda

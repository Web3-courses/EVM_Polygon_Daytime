This repo is specific to the EVM -> Polygon daytime course. 

## Pre-Requisites

The course requires a
Becoming a capable engineer cannot be taught over a period of an eight day bootcamp. The purpose of this bootcamp is to create capability that can be refined, adapted, grown and deployed over weeks, months and years. We aim to give developers a sound grounding in the technology so that they can become builders of great use cases tomorrow.

## Overview of Course Syllabus

The course is an eight day, intensive, full day bootcamp where students are expected to also complete reading, homework and consider core concepts to progress their knowledge overnight. The course is broken down into the following overview.

# Week_01
## Day_01 - An Introduction to Blockchains via Bitcoin

This is the first day of the full day version of the EVM → Polygon bootcamp.

In this session, we will cover some core cencepts that define the very theoretical understanding of what a blockchain is, how data is stored, the concept of immutabilithy and how security is created through decentralisation in concepts such as proof of work, mining and validation.

What is blockchain? → cryptography, Gossip protocol, byzantine fault tolerance, consensus protocols.
How does DLT work? → creation to the addition of a block with all transactions, Merkle trees.
Bitcoin whitepaper → Proof of work, mining and validation

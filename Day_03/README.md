# Week_01
## Day_03 : Polygon

This is the third day of the full day version of the EVM → Polygon bootcamp.

In this session, we will dive deeper into turing complete and its logical answer of GAS. Also, gas fees and optimizations are dicussed. Finally, Polygon is introduced with its applicabality and necessity for Ethereum transactions.
